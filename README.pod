=head1 METHODS AND ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item strip($string)

Strips away all Arabic short vowels (Tashkeel).

=item prune($string)

Heuristic for pruning the short vowels that a native speaker wouldn't write,
as leaving them out wouldn't introduce ambiguity.

This is often preferable to strip, as Shaddas, or Dammas that indicate a passive verb are useful clues that one might want to keep.

=item fix($string)

Transliterating from a romanized representation of Arabic to actual Arabic script often gives incorrect results regarding short/long vowels.

This subroutine implements a heuristic for fixing such mix ups.
